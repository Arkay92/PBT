## PBT (Physical Backed Token)

### Overview
NFT collectors enjoy collecting digital assets and sharing them with others online. However, there is currently no such standard for showcasing physical assets as NFTs with verified authenticity and ownership. Existing solutions are fragmented and tend to be susceptible to at least one of the following:
- The NFT cannot proxy as ownership of the physical item. In most current implementations, the NFT and physical item are functionally two decoupled distinct assets after the NFT mint, in which the NFT can be freely traded independently from the physical item.

- Verification of authenticity of the physical item requires action from a trusted entity (e.g. StockX).

PBT aims to mitigate these issues in a decentralized way through a new token standard (an extension of EIP-721).
